# UI mockup mockup
This document is a mockup of the UI mockup that we are supposed to make. Since we are only developers for now and have no designers that are willing to work for free on this, I am going to do something unprecedented and leave the design *completely up to the implementation*. What I mean by this is that I will only specify extremely general requirements for the UI, which can be tweaked as well during implementation if we find a better/prettier alternative.

#### Screens
We are going to have at least 3 screens in our application, two of which the user will always visit/ be in. The screens are:

1. Pick your campus screen: this is the starting screen of the application. The user gets to choose which campus they would like results from. This can be achieved via checkboxes, search boxes, and the like. It really doesn't matter.
2. Search/query and results screen: this is the screen which the user will probably be in for the majority of the time they are in the app. The users are supposed to search for courses: this is the purpose of this screen. If it is too little to be able to fit in all the functionality we want (such as searching by anything related to courses/timetables), it may be broken up into separate pieces if required.
3. Course screen: this is the screen that the user will be able to consult to see course metadata, and course timetable data. This is the page that will contain the functionality for the user to "add to timetable" if we implement it.

#### Extra Screens (If extended functionality is implemented)
1. Timetable screen: in this screen the user will be able to see their timetable(s).

#### Other UI elements
1. Settings screen: we will have a settings screen for the user to edit various application settings (such as rescraping, clearing their search history, setting notifications, and so on).
2. Share dialog, to share their timetables or to share various course metadata gathered from the app.
